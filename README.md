# Vulnerability-Scan

In preparation for the CYSA+ exam, I wanted to get some practice with vulnerability scanning, which is objective 1.3-1.4 on the exam. I have had practice in the past on platforms like RangeForce and TryHackMe, but every little bit helps.

I have created a virtual Windows network with a domain controller, two hosts and two servers to use for this practice.
